# object-oriented Programming

## Definition

OOP is a programming paradigm that resolves around the concept of objects, 
which are instances of classes. In OOP, objects are self-contained units that have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).


The process of designing and creating objects is called OOD. OOD involves identifying the objects that make up a system, 
defining their properties and behaviors, and determining how they interact with each other.

### The four fundamental principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, 
polymorphism, and abstraction. 

- **Encapsulation** refers to the practice of bundling data and behavior within an object and hiding the internal 
details of how the object works. 


- **Inheritance** is the process of creating 
new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes.


- **Polymorphism** allows objects to take on different forms, depending on 
their context. 

 
- **Abstraction** involves focusing on the essential properties 
and behavior of an object while ignoring irrelevant details.


## class

A "class" is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It describes the attributes and behaviors that objects of the class will have. A class defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects created from that class.


- To create an object in Java, a class must first exist.

- one class can create more than one object.


# Encapsulation

A mechanism that binds data and the functions that operate on that data, 
keeping them safe from outside interference and misuse.
